She had quite a few supporters.\n\nThank you for all the views and subscribers. 8K of you subbed to me because of this video.\n\nAbout what I've recently seen...\nI have become quite concerned about American society and its social care issues.\nPlease investigate *Kensington Ave homeless crisis* and ask yourself if that situation is acceptable in a civilized society. Wandering the streets and sleeping in gutters while your flesh rots to the bone, is not a \"life-style\", but a crisis.

There have been over 38K comments and I would now like to put the comment section to rest. I am sorry to say that the comments have been disabled as from the *10th September 2023* . Existing comments should remain in the system as far as I'm aware, so I can re-enable them upon request if anyone requires it. (Email on my About page)\n\nI wish the lady in this video good health, and hope she can be happy she has put a smile on many faces, as that's not a bad thing in this world right now. She had quite a few supporters.\n\nThank you for all the views and subscribers. 8K of you subbed to me because of this video.\n\nAbout what I've recently seen...\nI have become quite concerned about American society and its social care issues.\nPlease investigate *Kensington Ave homeless crisis* and ask yourself if that situation is acceptable in a civilized society. Wandering the streets and sleeping in gutters while your flesh rots to the bone, is not a \"life-style\", but a crisis. We can laugh at people, but we should also care about them. \n\n❤ *HELP THE LOST SOULS OF KENSINGTON AVE* ❤",

But this time, he isn't here to train anyone to win the All Valley Under 18 karate tournament. \n\nTo what do we owe this remastering of a master? Probably the blasphemous train wreck by Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith. After watching that, who can blame him? Seriously, \"...jacket off???\". This is supposed to be a kids movie. \n\nWell, one thing is for sure. \"Miyagi\" looks like no kids movie. It looks like a fast-paced, edge of your seat thriller. I don't know about you but being raised in the '80s with all the glory that was \"The Karate Kid,\" I, for one, can't wait!\n\nIf you like the trailer and want to see more teasers, please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel.

                    "description": "This 2025 holiday season, the McCallister's are back!  But Christmas can be a little sensitive for this family.  Join Kevin (Macaulay Culkin), Buzz (Devin Ratray) and Fuller (Kieran Culkin) as they return home for one big family reunion.  But not everybody enjoys Christmas.  The Wet Bandits (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) are back, and this time they're going to settle the score.\n\nWant to know how this video was made?\n\nLINK TO MAKING OF VIDEO:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT13FvOgL7s\n\nThis is a fan trailer (or a concept trailer).  These types of videos are often misunderstood.  They're not trying to \"fool\" you, they're creative pieces that transform existing footage into something new.  \n\nThrough the clever use of editing, professional voice artists, and lots of effects work, these videos transform existing footage into an imagined movie.  Sorry, that means this video isn't coming to the cinema anytime soon unfortunately.\n\nA little background about this video.  I originally started this two years ago but never finished it due to a lack of useable footage.  Both Macaulay Culkin and Joe Pesci have appeared in very few acting roles over the last 5 years.  Due to the lack of footage I found it very difficult to generate a storyline and the trailer sat unfinished for the last two years.  I finally got around to completing it this month, and the end result is a little... \"erratic\".  There's not much flow, but I tried my best.  This video was one of the most difficult I've created.  I hope you guys enjoy it.\n\nFootage used in this trailer came from the following sources\nHome Alone 1\nLove Ranch\nAdult Children of Divorce\nMrs Doubtfire\nThe Joe McGaffin Show\nApproaching A Breakthrough (Short)\nCompare the Market Commercial\nBlue Ruin\nWet Bandits Resurface (Daniel Stern Clip)\nDryvers\nMosaic\nKevin Defends Apartment (by Studio C)\nA Bad Mom's Christmas\nChristmas Inheritance\nLife of the Party\n\nAudio provided by CalanRobinson (voiceover) and Day Pheonix (voice actress) courtesy of Fiverr.\n#homealone #homealonechristmasreunion #macaulayculkin #2025trailer #homealone3",

But strange reports start to surface of a mysterious body washing up on shore.\n\nJack must make an important decision.  Will he risk it all and return to Rose?\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson.  Kate Winslet as Rose Dewitt Bukater.  Kathy Bates as Molly Brown.  This is the 2025 sequel trailer.\n\nYes, this trailer is fake.  It's a parody trailer (sometimes called a fan trailer or concept trailer).  It's been created by editing together existing footage to create a new, original narrative.\n\nThese types of videos are often misunderstood.  They take existing content, and through the use of editing, voice artists, special effects and music a new stand work is created.\n\nThis is my third attempt at a Titanic 2 trailer.  My previous two videos were Titanic 2: Jacks Back and Titanic 2: Never Forget.  This third attempt is my version of the \"happy ending\".  My previous two videos were a lot darker.\n\nSince posting this video I've made a lot more Titanic related videos including The Rose Diaries (a long form short film where I look at Rose's life after Titanic.  I also made a sci-fi trailer called Titanic 2: Rise of the Clones that's a lot more funny.\n\nThanks the following voice artists for lending their talents to this video.  Check them out on Fiverr.\n\nnmessina1490, Vobarb, sturoyce and calanrobinson\n\nIf you enjoyed this trailer then check out some of my other work including Harry Potter and the Demon Child, Home Alone Christmas Reunion, The Nanny Returns, Lion King Reborn, Monsters Inc 2: Return of Boo and many many more!\n\n#titanic2 #leonardodicaprio #trailer #katewinslet #titanic #2025",

On their own, without the guidance of their professors or the protection of Professor Dumbledore, the three friends must now rely on one another more than ever. But there are Dark Forces in their midst that threaten to tear them apart.\n\nMeanwhile, the wizarding world has become a dangerous place for all enemies of the Dark Lord. The long-feared war has begun and Voldemort's Death Eaters seize control of the Ministry of Magic and even Hogwarts, terrorizing and arresting anyone who might oppose them. But the one prize they still seek is the one most valuable to Voldemort: Harry Potter. The Chosen One has become the hunted one as the Death Eaters search for Harry with orders to bring him to Voldemort... alive.\n\nHarry's only hope is to find the Horcruxes before Voldemort finds him. But as he searches for clues, he uncovers an old and almost forgotten tale-the legend of the Deathly Hallows. And if the legend turns out to be true, it could give Voldemort the ultimate power he seeks.\n\nLittle does Harry know that his future has already been decided by his past when, on that fateful day, he became \"the Boy Who Lived.\" No longer just a boy, Harry Potter is drawing ever closer to the task for which he has been preparing since the day he first stepped into Hogwarts: the ultimate battle with Voldemort.\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows trailer courtesy Warner Bros.

                    "description": "Are you ready to go back to Titanic?  Jack (Leonardo Dicaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet) reunite in this new Titanic 2 reboot trailer. On an expedition to retrieve the priceless heart of the ocean diamond, a recovery team makes a shocking discovery.  \n\nThis trailer was created in collaboration with Billy Crammer.  \nCheck out his work.  It's super amazing!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVr5w2wms3tkdZFmXbrY_nA\n\nThis trailer has an interesting history.  It's a reboot of my first Titanic 2 trailer (Jacks Back) which has over 50 million views.  I wanted to take the same plot, but give it a modern take and update it to be more realistic.  Everything was redone for this video.  New voices were recorded, new effects work, new music, and new footage filmed.  There is also a big plot twist this time around.\n\nThis trailer is also my first ever collaboration.  It's a 2025 version.  I hired a super talented editor by the name of Billy Crammer to create this.  Check out his channel for amazing, high quality edits (his stuff always looks professional, mine is a little more silly).  He did a brilliant job creating the core of this video, then I went in and added some silliness to match the content of my regular work.\n\nAnd if you're reading this far and you're still confused, this is not a real movie.  It's a parody trailer (sometimes called a fan trailer or concept trailer).  Fan trailers take existing material and through the use of editing, effects work, voiceovers and music, a new and original narrative is created.\n\nThese types of videos are a great way to gauge interest in a new film or sequel (plus they're a fantastic creative outlet).\n\nThis is actually my fourth Titanic 2 trailer.  I have the original Jacks Back (which this is based on).  There is also Titanic 2: Never Let Go which is the horror sequel.  And finally there's the feel-good, happy ending in Titanic 2: The Return of Jack. \n\nIf you enjoyed this trailer please check out some of my previous work including Speed 3: Flight Risk, The Nanny Reboot, Harry Potter and the Demon Child, Home Alone: Christmas Reunion and many many more.  Thanks guys!\n\n#titanic2 #titanic #2025 #2025trailer #trailer",

Fan trailers are often misunderstood.  These videos transform existing footage through the use of editing, professional voice artists, and heavy effects work (in After Effects).  \n\nThese videos take many weeks of editing to create.  I take existing content and transform it into an entirely original fictional film.  Unfortunately that this movie WON'T be coming to a cinema anytime soon. \n\nInside Out is possibly  my favourite Pixar film of all time (I saw it twice in the cinema).  I had so much fun making this video because I knew exactly what I wanted to do from the start.  It has a really strong narrative and my heaviest effects work to date!\n\nAnytime you create a fantrailer of an animated film it requires a huge amount of time to edit.  Because I only have the source material to work from I had to manipulate every shot in a way to make it follow the new plot.  \n\nFootage used in this trailer came from the following sources\nBig Hero 6\nUp\nMaury Povich - Worst Teens\nFrozen\nKeeping Up With The Kardashians\nMTV 2015 Movie Awards\nParks and Recreation\nRileys First Date (Short)\nShoes of Doom (Short)\nBad Teacher\nToy Story\nand\nInside Out\n\nVoiceover provided by heresricky courtesty of Fiverr\n\nSubscribe for more parody trailers #trailer #2023trailer #movietrailer #insideout2 #insideout",

                    "description": "My EP is FREE at: http://www.Patreon.com/JackConte\nThis Song on iTunes: http://tinyurl.com/ConteWakeMeUp\n\nThis is a 3D projection mapping music video for my remix of Avicii's Wake Me Up.  I used Final Cut Pro 7 to line up all the images, and I built the 3D screens and surfaces out of foam core (the kind we used to use for science fair projects....).  I didn't use any custom software or non consumer products to make this video - the projection mapping was done empirically by lining up images on foam core board and then cutting the board down to the appropriate sizes - no math or algorithms or projection mapping software.\n\n100% original sound design - no samples used.\nFilmed in one take, start to finish with an iPhone, two Canon Vixia home video cameras, and a Canon T3i.\nRecorded, mixed and mastered with Ableton Live 8.\n\nHow I made the main bass sounds:\nI started with live guitar (my Nelson Coquette), pitch shifted it an octave down using the Electro Harmonix POG pedal, and ran it through the Big Muff Germanium.  Then I used Ableton's Saturator to square off the waveform.  I added three layers of Native Instruments Massive to add some breath and cracking to the top end of the spectrum, giving the bass a fuzzy \"broken speaker\" flapping sound.  I also added a sub bass (pure sine wave) that doubled the live bass take.  More info and in-depth tutorials for my patrons at: http://www.Patreon.com/JackConte\n\nIf you'd like me to keep making videos, please support me on Patreon!\nhttp://www.Patreon.com/JackConte\n\nDO NOT READ THIS IF YOU'RE NOT A FAN:\nSorry for the disclaimer - but I want to filter out the riff raff!  I hope you like this video.  I poured my HEART and SOUL into the sound design, mixing, projections, and set building. It took me more time than I even feel comfortable divulging in public!  The point is this: I LOVE MAKING STUFF, and I want to make more.  You might think that ad revenue has us YouTubers rolling in copious sums of filthy green - after all, people get rich and famous by getting millions of views on YouTube, right?  Like for instance, my Daft Punk Skrillex mashup, that recently crossed 5 million views.  I got BALLS RICH from that video, right?  I bought a boat with a jacuzzi on top, filled it with Don Perrignon, and hired Tiesto to dj my private yacht party....right?  Actually... I didn't get a single penny from that video.  Not a cent!  It took me 30 days to make the audio and two weeks to animate the visuals - and I didn't earn enough to pay for a gummy bear.  I'm not talking about a 32 oz bag of gummy bears on Amazon for $12.99 - I'm talking about A. SINGLE. GUMMY BEAR.  And by the way, I'm not complaining - I know that online content is free.  But PEOPLE are not free - it costs money to live on planet Earth!  Here's what I'm asking you to do: even if you don't want to become a patron of me, please check out Patreon.com, and find a couple of artists that you LOVE, and help them make more beautiful things to put into the world.

Or check out Yotam Perel who makes hilarious animations: http://www.patreon.com/lazypillow .  Or try Peter Hollens, whose voice makes anybody melt: http://www.patreon.com/peterhollens .  It's getting harder and harder for creators to make a living these days - music is available for free now.  Videos are free.  Blog posts are free.  If you enjoy someone's art, please consider becoming a patron and helping them make more.  Thank you for reading this and for caring!

Mélusine agrees to marry Raymondin on the condition that he never see her on Saturdays. He agrees but is later convinced by his brother to break his promise, piercing his wife’s door with a sword and finding her naked in the bath, half snake, half woman. When she catches him spying on her, she turns into a dragon and flies away, only to reappear every time one of her descendants is on their deathbed.\n\nD'UN FEU SECRET\n(Michel Lambert, air de cour, 1660)  \n\nD'un feu secret je me sens consumer \nSans pouvoir soulager le mal qui me possède;\n  \nJe pourrois bien guérir si je cessois d'aymer, \nMais j'ayme mieux le mal que le remède. \n  \nQuand je mourrois, pourroit-on me blasmer ? \nQui commence d’aymer , ne doit-il pas poursuivre ? \n  \nQuand on sçaura, Philis, que j'ay cessé d'aymer, \nOn saura bien que j'ay cessé de vivre. \n \n///\n\nBy a secret a fire \nI feel myself \nI feel myself being consumed \nWithout being able to relieve the pain that possesses me \n\nI could be cured \nIf I stopped loving \nBut I prefer the disease than the remedy \n\nWhen I die, will they be able to blame me? \nThe one who begins to love, should he not pursue? \n\nWhen they know, Mélusine, \nThat I have ceased loving \nThey will surely know, that I have ceased living \n\n#cecilemclorinsalvant #animation",

His work spans decades and it took multiple tries to understand it in a way that could be put together in a narrative. I am very grateful for all of his time, warmth and generosity. I had to leave many, many wonderful pieces of research and factoids out due to time constraints but I would urge any of you that are interested to dive deeper into his work. \n\nHis colleagues Dr. William G. Ryerson, Ms. Amanda E.
